According to the statement, the Syrian Democratic Forces established a joint operations center Saturday night for the military campaign "Euphrates Rage," which includes multiple Arab, Kurdish and Turkmen militia groups. The operation was announced just days after Iraqi forces entered the city of Mosul, where they are now in a fierce battle with ISIS militants. There has been no official comment by the US-led coalition regarding the launch of a new Raqqa offensive.', 5, '2016-11-04 00:34:17'),

They\'re accused of collaboration with ETA and giving shelter to Irastorza in their house, the statement added.\r\nListed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union, ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France.\r\nIn 2011, ETA announced "a definitive cessation of its armed activity," raising hopes that decades of separatist violence might finally be over.\r\nAuthorities have continued their efforts since then to arrest the group\'s members.\r\nCNN\'s Sofia Fernandes contributed to this report.', 5, '2016-11-04 00:39:10'),
